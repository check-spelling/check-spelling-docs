# Timing Report

🏗️ Mostly for debugging, if you're wondering which files are "expensive", you can ask check-spelling to generate a csv file with rough information about the start and end times for processing each file.

```yaml
        report-timing: 1
```

Expected release: [v0.0.22](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.22)
