The checking format that GitHub Workflows use is derived from the one that Visual Studio Code uses.

As such, talking to VSCode would actually be a neat trick, and perhaps less of a stretch than some other things.

The biggest problem is dealing with how to package something written in Shell+Perl. (The easiest approach is porting to JavaScript/TypeScript, but for the time being this is not remotely in the cards.)

It's possible to only offer to work if `Perl`/`Docker` or an equivalent are present.

I don't have any particular plans to implement this, but as I'm starting to use VSCode, it's something I'm thinking about.
