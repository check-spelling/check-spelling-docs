# Subrepos

Subrepos enable a git repository to reference other git repositories.

## Disclaimers

* I generally don't use subrepos.
* Handled subrepos can result in additional security vulnerabilities.
* There are different approaches to checking them out to try to avoid tripping over the previous point...
* I don't think that GitHub will allow annotations on items from subrepositories.
* I suspect that properly tagging errors in subrepos will be fairly hard (essentially each file reference needs to do some complicated lookup instead of assuming the path is correct).

## Just do it

Caveats aside, a naive implementation that ignores all the likely problems and at least is able to report unrecognized words as seen in a checkout shouldn't be too hard.

## Workaround

If you need something before this feature is implemented, you can basically remove the `.git` directory, do a `git init`, a `git add .`, and a `git commit` before check-spelling runs.
