# Honor gitattributes

GitHub Linguist recognizes [vendored code](https://github.com/github/linguist#vendored-code).

Since this action is designed to run in GitHub repositories, it is quite possible people will add `linguist-vendored` or `linguist-generated` annotations.

It'd be nice if these were automatically recognized instead of relying on people to add them to `excludes`.
