# Autodetect noisy files

## Problem space

There are a couple categories of files to consider:

- binaries (e.g. pictures / audio / video)
- files written in natural languages not recognized by the dictionary

## Possible strategies

Consider keeping stats on a per file / line basis...

Look for new filename extensions?
