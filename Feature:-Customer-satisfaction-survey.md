# Customer satisfaction survey

It'd be nice to be able to provide something like this:

<details><summary>❓How did this comment make you feel</summary>

(The bullets are necessary because GitHub Wiki markdown doesn't behave the same as GitHub markdown.)

In a Comment or a Step Summary, the form could also prefill the url for the PR / commit. But for a Comment, there really wouldn't be enough space.

As such, this probably won't be implemented until after switching to [Job Summaries](./Behavior-change:-Job-Summaries).
