# Behavior change: Ignoring two letter words

Afaict, two letter words just aren't worth the effort of spell checking.

I will take implementation feedback. But, `prerelease` now, and `0.0.18-alpha` (when it's released), by default, will not complain about two letter words.

See [Autodetect valid word lengths](./Feature:-Autodetect-valid-word-lengths.md) for more information.
