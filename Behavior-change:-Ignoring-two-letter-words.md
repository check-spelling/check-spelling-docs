# Behavior change: Ignoring two letter words

As of [v0.0.18](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.18), by default, check-spelling will not complain about two letter words.

Afaict, two letter words just aren't worth the effort of spell checking.

See [[Autodetect valid word lengths|Feature: Autodetect valid word lengths]] for more information.
