# Behavior change: Ignoring two letter words

Afaict, two letter words just aren't worth the effort of spell checking.

I will take implementation feedback. But, [v0.0.18](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.18), by default, will not complain about two letter words.

See [[Autodetect valid word lengths|Feature: Autodetect valid word lengths]] for more information.
