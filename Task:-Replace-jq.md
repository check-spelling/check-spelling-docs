# Replace jq

`jq` is a handy tool for writing shell scripts, but it's also frustrating.

Perl (5.14+) provides [JSON::PP](https://perldoc.perl.org/JSON::PP) which can handle the json parsing side of things.
Evaluating then becomes a problem for Perl instead of another programming language.

## Tasks

&#x2611; `--slurpfile` is pretty magical, but it's only used in one place

&#x2610; `wrap_in_json` is a function, so replacing it should be pretty easy

&#x2610; `wrap_file_in_json` is a function, so replacing it should be pretty easy

&#x2610; `jq -s` is used once

&#x2610; `jq --arg` is used once in a call curl which could be replaced by `gh`

&#x2610; `jq length` is used once

&#x2610; `jq` w/o `-r` has a handful of other uses which probably should all have `-r`

&#x2610; `jq -r` is used >80 times -- they're all fairly simple, but replacing them will probably happen as more code is refactored from shell to perl
