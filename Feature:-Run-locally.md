# Running locally to check for new errors

Possible approaches:

* [Act](#act)
* [Single script](#single-script)
* [Docker image](#docker-image)

## Act

[Act](https://github.com/nektos/act) is a tool which uses Docker to run GitHub Actions locally.

You should generally use the [latest version of act](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/latest).

### General status
Act [v0.2.24](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/tag/v0.2.24)+ should work reasonably well...

Running `act` in a repository with `push` and `pull_request_target` (with `suppress_push_for_open_pull_request`) should work.

```

You can use `perl -pne 's{^\| }{}'` to strip the Act padding when check-spelling provides a script that it wants you to run (you can of course always manually apply the equivalent changes).

### Concerns

Nektos/Act may be missing support for newer GitHub Action features:

* [pull_request_target](https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/)
* [workflow_run](https://github.blog/2020-08-03-github-actions-improvements-for-fork-and-pull-request-workflows/)
* [GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY](https://github.blog/2022-05-09-supercharging-github-actions-with-job-summaries/)

#### Output steps
As of Act [v0.2.24](https://github.com/nektos/act/releases/tag/v0.2.24), act can't handle [outputs from later steps](https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/758), as used in [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/prerelease/.github/workflows/spelling.yml#L17](https://github.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/blob/18764e6cbb019a5d2067d6abe62ce43eb83275bd/.github/workflows/spelling.yml#L17) - It's possible to build a [patched version of act](https://github.com/ChristopherHX/act/commit/4c692919754ab0a72b340604e2c5c597e95f463a) -- but it requires fixing a [merge failure](https://github.com/jsoref/act/commit/a8f69e39d9b534d4eef09f37ab0d082cd308bb00). This shouldn't be a big deal as the output portions of the workflow won't work in act anyway...


## Single script

The original tool was self contained, but the current script is considerably fancier...

As the script slowly evolves from shell+perl+jq to perl+jq (it could switch from perl+jq to node), maybe it could become a single script again.

In the long term, I'd rather this, but I don't expect to implement this anytime soon.

## Docker image

I investigated using Docker directly and did in the initial versions.

‚ö†Ô∏è The Docker file is no longer the main entrypoint in GitHub as of [0.0.16-alpha](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/0.0.16-alpha).

Support was removed in an [v0.0.20](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.20).

If you want to use check-spelling in Docker, please consider using `act` which wraps Docker...
