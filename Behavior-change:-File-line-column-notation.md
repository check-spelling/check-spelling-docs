# File line column notation

Through v0.0.20, file / line / column references were in human text

As of v0.0.21, the notation will be something like: `.github/workflows/spelling.yml:54:9 ... 21`

filename:line-number:initial-offset ... end-offset.

This should be friendlier to tools like `vi` or `VSCode`.
