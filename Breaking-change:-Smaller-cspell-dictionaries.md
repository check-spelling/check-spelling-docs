# Smaller cspell dictionaries

The cspell dictionaries that check-spelling can borrow aren't designed for cspell and just contain tokens that have been harvested by [streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts](https://github.com/streetsidesoftware/cspell-dicts).

As check-spelling only wants words and not CamelCased tokens, any entry that has üê´ or that has punctuation will be ignored, and thus is a waste of bandwidth and processing time. It hasn't really mattered a lot so far, but it turned out to be low-hanging fruit.

If you want to continue using your v0.0.20 configured cspell items, you can add this line to your workflow anywhere you have a reference to `cspell:`:
```yaml
with:
  dictionary_source_prefixes: '{"cspell": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/cspell-dicts/v20220427/dictionaries/"}'
```
