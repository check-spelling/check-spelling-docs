## v0.0.26

[v0.0.26](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.26)

- ℹ️ [Unused configuration file warning](./Feature:-Unused-configuration-file-warning)
- ⏭️ [Ignore next line](./Feature:-ignore‐next‐line)
- 🏴 [Flag homoglyphs in words](./Feature:-Flag-homoglyphs-in-words)
- ⚙️ [`config.json`](Configuration-Files#config) for defining configuration using `json` instead of in workflows. This should make it easier to merge configuration/use unified configuration. It also enables `load-config-from`
- ⚙️ [`load-config-from`](Configuration#load-config-from) -- GitHub changed the behavior of workflows running via `pull_request_target` to rely on the default branch for configuration.  You can use this setting to allow interpreting specific settings from `config.json` from the base branch (or the head branch).
- [Permission check for pull requests from forks](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/issues/103) -- GitHub broke an API at the beginning of April 2026
- Ignore `suppress_push_for_open_pull_request` when [pull requests are disabled](https://github.blog/changelog/2026-02-13-new-repository-settings-for-configuring-pull-request-access/)
- [Git config is no longer edited](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/issues/94)
- Fix GitHub code scanning detection -- GitHub changed the response previously used to identify its availability
- Waits for hunspell dictionary downloads to resolve before proceeding to check spelling
- Switched to using UTF8
- Switched from `:...:` to unicode emoji
- Improved pattern parsing and handling of broken patterns
- Removed most use of `rsync`
- Comment task no longer requires a `checkout` (all information is produced in the `spelling` task and packaged in the artifact)
- Added `allow-hunspell` -- for use as `allow-hunspell: false` to disable hunspell support
- Improved YAML parsing
- Candidate and Forbidden Patterns will now automatically expand if there are only **one** or **two**
