# `advice` Examples

Advice is a file that is inserted raw into GitHub comments (or potentially in the log if the commit results in stale expect items and no unexpected items).

Here are some examples:
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/terminal/main/.github/actions/spelling/advice.md
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imazen/imageflow/main/.github/actions/spell-check/advice.txt
* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsoref/jitsi-videobridge/e26301eab0a15f2366f5d2b73e2c0cc714007a14/.github/actions/spell-check/advice.txt

```
<details><summary>If you see a bunch of garbage and it relates to a binary-ish string</summary>

Please add a file path to the `excludes.txt` file instead of just accepting the garbage.

File paths are Perl 5 Regular Expressions - you can [test](
https://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/perl/) yours before committing to verify it will match your files.

`^` refers to the file's path from the root of the repository, so `^README\.md$` would exclude [README.md](https://github.com/check-spelling-bot/example/blob/master/README.md) (on whichever branch you're using).
