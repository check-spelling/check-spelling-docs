# Suppress commenting

Included in [v0.0.20](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.20)

Some projects would like to have the CI ❌ behavior w/o the GitHub comments.

Especially for projects where people make lots of commits while a PR is open and don't squash-rebase as they go (before merge).

## Using

```
with:
  post_comment: true
```

## CI State

The bot would still trigger the ❌ (which if the project enables blocking PRs for would be enough).

## Logs

The logs would still have the reporting.

## Comment after the fact

An artifact can be generated containing enough information to produce a comment. As of [v0.0.20](https://github.com/check-spelling/check-spelling/releases/tag/v0.0.20), the [recommended workflow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/spell-check-this/main/.github/workflows/spelling.yml) uses this artifact to produce a comment.

It would be possible to generate a compatible artifact and then comment after the fact...

I could probably also once I turn on talk-to-bot include an option for `@check-spelling-bot report` or similar to have the bot post the comment. Or possibly even `@check-spelling-bot report REFERENCE` if the bot persists enough to be able to regenerate the comment w/o doing the work (this is something I'm close to doing for other stuff).

It's unlikely that I'll do this, as I'm more likely to work on GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY support.
