# Dictionaries with unique value

Some dictionaries will have high overlap with other dictionaries.

## Evolving the available supplemental dictionary report

## In prerelease

They're now shown in table form which will make it easier to expose an extra column of data...

### Available dictionaries could cover words not in the dictionary

Dictionary | Entries | Covers
-|-|-
[cspell:software-terms/src/software-terms.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/cspell-dicts/v20220816/dictionaries/software-terms/src/software-terms.txt)|1237|3|
[cspell:java/java.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/cspell-dicts/v20220816/dictionaries/java/java.txt)|7642|2|
[cspell:cpp/src/cpp.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/cspell-dicts/v20220816/dictionaries/cpp/src/cpp.txt)|30216|2|
[cspell:clojure/src/clojure.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/check-spelling/cspell-dicts/v20220816/dictionaries/clojure/src/clojure.txt)|89|1|

Consider adding them using (in `.github/workflows/spelling.yml`):
``` yml
      with:
        extra_dictionaries:
          cspell:software-terms/src/software-terms.txt
          cspell:java/java.txt
          cspell:cpp/src/cpp.txt
          cspell:clojure/src/clojure.txt
```
To stop checking additional dictionaries, add:
``` yml
      with:
        check_extra_dictionaries: ''
```

## Expose unique entries, common entries, total entries

> dictionary (_unique matching entries_, _common matching entries_, _total entries_)

Where _unique matching entries_ + _common matching entries_ = _matching entry count_.

An entry in a dictionary would be scored into _unique matching entries_ only if it isn't present in other dictionaries.
