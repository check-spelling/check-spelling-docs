# Autodetect valid word lengths

With [Heuristic exclude suggestions](./Feature:-Heuristic-exclude-suggestions.md), I've started reviewing what's worth checking.

For one, a significant portion of the two letter space is already in the dictionary.

For another, programmers often develop two letter sequences, either as abbreviations or identifiers.

In a recent pull request of mine, every single 2 letter pair that was flagged was valid.

I know of one repository with a run of `a`s that exceeds 32766 characters.

The checker (while reading the dictionary) will find the shortest and longest word lengths.
* Unless overridden, it will ignore things that are shorter than the shortest word length (at least 3). 
* Unless overridden, it will ignore things that are longer than two characters longer than the longest word (this allows one to accidentally add two characters to a long word and still be flagged for a typo).

There are now two flags to configure the length of "words":

* `shortest_word` -- you can set this to `"2"` to restore the old behavior
* `longest_word` -- you could set this to some obscene number like `"32767"` to get closer to the old behavior
