# Avoid using colors in names

I received feedback that colors were problematic.

To address this, I've add support for:

* `expect` <=> `whitelist`

I've made this the primary term and am offering the old one for backward compatibility (along w/ making PRs to existing consumers to migrate).

In some ways, `expect` is actually more accurate as the action tries to prune the list of things which are no longer necessary.
