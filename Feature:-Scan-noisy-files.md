# Scan noisy files

Sometimes you may want to scan a file even if it has more unrecognized words than recognized words.

By default, the [Autodetect noisy files](./Feature:-Autodetect-noisy-files.md) feature would talk about these files,
and suggest adding them to `excludes.txt`.

If, you need these files to be checked, you can add:

```workflow
with:
  disable_checks: noisy-file
```
to your configuration.
