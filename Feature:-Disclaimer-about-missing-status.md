# Disclaimer about missing status

If you're using [Update expect list](./Feature:-Update-expect-list), unfortunately at this time the status will retain its ❌ until an additional commit is added by something other than the GitHub bot.

An extra comment will be added to explain this and make it easier to work around this restriction.
